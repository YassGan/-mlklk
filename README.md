# Video-Editing-Portfolio

This portfolio project showcases my skills in video editing. I started by selecting a template that I found appealing, and then adapted it to fit my personal preferences.

In the process of creating this project, I learned how to take an existing codebase and adapt it to meet my specific needs. This involved customizing various aspects of the template, such as the layout, color scheme, and fonts. By doing so, I was able to create a unique portfolio that reflects my personal style and showcases my video editing skills.

Overall, this project serves as a testament to my ability to work with existing code and tailor it to meet my specific needs. I hope that it provides a comprehensive showcase of my skills and abilities in video editing, and demonstrates my proficiency in web development.
